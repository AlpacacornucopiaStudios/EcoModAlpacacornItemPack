To install, just place the mod folder AlpacacornItemPack in your server's Mods -> UserCode folder and restart your server.

Feel free to update the .cs files for balancing purposes (let me know if you think something is way off and I can adjust it, as well).

Let me know on mod.io if you have any further plushie requests or balancing suggestions!

All models are original & made in Blender with textures created using Adobe Substance Painter. No AI was used in the creation of this item pack.
